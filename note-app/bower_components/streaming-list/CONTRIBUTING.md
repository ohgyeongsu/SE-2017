# Polymer Elements
## Guide for Contributors

Polymer Elements are built in the open, and the Polymer authors eagerly encourage any and all forms of community contribution. When contributing, please follow these guidelines:

### Filing Issues

**If you are filing an issue to request a feature**, please provide a clear description of the feature. It can be helpful to describe answers to the following questions:

 1. **Who will use the feature?** _“As someone filling out a form…”_
 2. **When will they use the feature?** _“When I enter an invalid value…”_
 3. **What is the user’s goal?** _“I want to be visually notified that the value needs to be corrected…”_

**If you are filing an issue to report a bug**, please provide:

 1. **A clear description of the bug and related expectations.** Consider using the following example template for reporting a bug:

 ```markdown
 The `paper-foo` element causes the page to turn pink when clicked.

 ## Expected outcome

 The page stays the same color.

 ## Actual outcome

 The page turns pink.

 ## Steps to reproduce

 1. Put a `paper-foo` element in the page.
 2. Open the page in a web browser.
 3. Click the `paper-foo` element.
 ```

 2. **A reduced test case that demonstrates the problem.** If possible, please include the test case as a JSBin. Start with this template to easily import and use relevant Polymer Elements: [http://jsbin.com/cagaye](http://jsbin.com/cagaye/edit?html,output).

 3. **A list of browsers where the problem occurs.** This can be skipped if the problem is the same across all browsers.

### Submitting Pull Requests

**Before creating a pull request**, please ensure that an issue exists for the corresponding change in the pull request that you intend to make. **If an issue does not exist, please create one per the guidelines above**. The goal is to discuss the design and necessity of the proposed change with Polymer authors and community before diving into a pull request.

When submitting pull requests, please provide:

 1. **A reference to the corresponding issue** or issues that will be closed by the pull request. Please refer to these issues using the following syntax:

 ```markdown
 (For a single issue)
 Fixes #20

 (For multiple issues)
 Fixes #32, #40
 ```

 2. **A succinct description of the design** used to fix any related issues. For example:

 ```markdown
 This fixes #20 by removing styles that leaked which would cause the page to turn pink whenever `paper-foo` is clicked.
 ```

 3. **At least one test for each bug fixed or feature added** as part of the pull request. Pull requests that fix bugs or add features without accompanying tests will not be considered.

If a proposed change contains multiple commits, please [squash commits](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request) to as few as is necessary to succinctly express the change. A Polymer author can help you squash commits, so don’t be afraid to ask us if you need help with that!

## <a name="commit"></a> Git Commit Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.  But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the Element change log**.

The commit message formatting can be added using a typical git workflow or through the use of a CLI wizard ([Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)). To use the wizard, run `npm run commit` in your terminal after staging your changes in git.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `docs`, `tests`, `element`, etc...

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

A detailed explanation can be found in this [document][commit-message-format].
